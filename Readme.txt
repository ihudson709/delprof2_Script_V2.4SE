DeleteStudentProfiles Script Version 2.4SE
Created by Ian Hudson

This is a batch file for a DOS GUI for the Delprof2 utility.

2.4 Added features:

* Added deletion of profiles that begin with the number "4".
* Added ablility to Run from School Server hence the "SE" at the end of the version number meaning Server Edition.


2.3 Added features:

* "RunMode" displays in the Title Bar of the DOS Window.
RunMode is simply what you chose from the Menu as to how to run the script. 'List Only', 'Run Once' or 'Continuous' Modes. 

* "Processing Room" displays in the Title Bar of the DOS Window. You are now prompted for what room you are running the script on. So if you run several sessions at the same time, you don't have to remember which Window is for what room. 

* Added "Beep" noise when 'List Only' and 'Run Once' modes have completed.

* Added "Processing Room" info to Log when running "List Only" mode.
